# ML Nanodegree Capstone Project
## Project overview
The project relates to using deep learning in computer vision domain specifically in autonmous driving . it's an implementation to NVIDIA's paper (End-To-End Learning For Self-Driving Cars) which is an end to end cnn that can map raw images to steering angles
